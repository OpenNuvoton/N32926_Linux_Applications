This is a sample code to program YAFFS2 file system image
to NAND flash and mount it to /mnt/yaffs2 on FA92 platform.

Please copy the image files under folder "example_image" to 
the folder of mn_writer and run "./mount_yaffs2.sh" for testing only.

You should replace these image files with your own image files to
burn your NAND flash.
